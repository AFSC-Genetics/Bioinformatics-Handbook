It is good practice to always update your scripts on both your local drive copy and on Sedna in order to keep track of changes you have made. Whether you write/edit locally or on sedna is your personal preference, but ensure you keep an updated copy on both locations.\n\n#### Sublime Text\n\nIN PROGRESS\n\n#### vim\n\nIN PROGRESS\n\n### Moving files to and from servers\n\nTo move a files, you should use the `scp` command which is generally formatted as follows `scp <path from source> <path to destination>`\n\nTo move a file from your local computer to sedna you can use the following script:\n\n::: {#cf8263d0 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nscp -P 22 <username>@161.55.52.157:<SEDNA_PATH>/<filename> <LOCAL_PATH>\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo move a file from sedna to your local computer you can use the following:\n\n::: {#ec17d322 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nscp -P 22 <LOCAL_PATH>\\<filename> <username>@sedna.nwfsc2.noaa.gov:<SEDNA_PATH>\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo move an entire directory you would add the `-r` flag:\n\n::: {#69d67c0a .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nscp -P 22 -r <username>@161.55.52.157:<SEDNA_PATH>/<foldername> <LOCAL_PATH>\n```\n:::\n\n\n",
