## Guide for Setting up Project Directory

Before beginning a project, you'll want to set up a directory for your project. This can be named in whatever flavor you want, but an example would be setting a directory with the date you began the project and a few word description (e.g., 20231106_pcod_lcWGS). Alternatively if you work on a number of different projects for a given species and those analyses don't interact maybe you want a header directory called 'pcod' and then within that a subfolder with that dates run (e.g., 20231106_lcWGS).
